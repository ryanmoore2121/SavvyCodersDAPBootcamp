    "# Week 4 Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does one need to do to use a module?\n",
    "You need to import the module into your program using import \"module\".  Such as import datetime as dt. This will import the module and you can begin to use it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.\n",
    "Math module. \n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"The sum of this list is \", math.fsum([1, 2, 3,]))\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print: The sum of this list is 6.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a benefit of using Exception handling?\n",
    "This allows us to not generate an error from Python that would have made the program crash, instead we can run the code and prevent the error message from occuring.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?\n",
    "- The try block that lets you run the block of code for errors.\n",
    "- The except block that lets you handle the error. \n",
    "- The else blck that lets you execute code when there is no error. \n",
    "- The finally block that lets you run the code regardless of the results of the try and except blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?\n",
    "NumPy Arrays are like lists but require less memory, are faster, and more convenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.\n",
    "They require less memory and as a result run faster which can be very beneficial with large data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "The datatype must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations\n",
    "- Statistical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?\n",
    "We will use Matplotlib to create data visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the shape of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "The shape is a tuple that specifies the dimensions, length, and size of each array.\n",
    "For one dimensional arrays it might have the shape of (4) where 4 is the number of elements in an array. \n",
    "For two dimensional array it might have the shape of (3,5) where 3 is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Tensor?\n",
    "A tensoru is an array with 3 or more dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?\n",
    "NumPy uses less memory, is faster, and more convenient to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When creating an \"empty\" array, where do the elements come from?\n",
    "The elements come from the block of memory it allocated. \n"
