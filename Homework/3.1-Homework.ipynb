    "1. #### What is an algorithm? \n",
    "    Algorithms are a series of steps to solve a problem at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Why is Python considered to be a high-level language?\n",
    "    Python is a high-level language becuase the program must be processed before they can be run by a computer. Python is made so that is it easier for us to understand but this requires the computer to convert the program into machine language so that the computer can understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Is Python a Natural or a Formal language?\n",
    "    Python is consideed a formal language. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Variable names may not start with certain characters - name two.\n",
    "    Variable names cannot start with a number or characters such as @, #, $. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. #### What is a Semantic error?\n",
    "    A semantic error is code that is grammatically correct but doesn't make any sense and it doesn't produce the results we expect this could be code such as asking for the sum of two numbers by coding it like:\n",
    "    num1 = \"1\" num2 = \"1\" sum = num 1 + num 2 print(sum)\n",
    "    This will print 11 and not the expected 2 because of the paranthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. #### What is the #1 rule of coding / debugging?\n",
    "    Complexity is the enemy of efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. #### List 5 Python reserved words.\n",
    "    and, none, true, false, if  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. #### Add and name, a web link for any Python coding article, in your markdown cell\n",
    "    Data Structures in Python:  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html \n"
